# 12 — Conformance test catalog

This document enumerates every stable conformance test identifier in the form
`XXX-NNN`. Every language flavor MUST implement a passing test for each ID in its
`langs/<lang>/tests/conformance/` directory before it can be marked stable. CI
verifies this via `tools/check-conformance-coverage.py`.

Each source spec file (e.g., `02-lifecycle.md`) carries a `## Conformance` section
listing its applicable ID range. When adding a new ID, update both the catalog (here)
and the source spec's `## Conformance` section.

## 2. Reading entries

Each entry below follows Given/When/Then. Implementers map Given to test setup, When
to the operation under test, and Then to assertions.

### 2.1 Notation conventions

Within Given/When/Then prose:

- `Status == Constructed` is a state assertion (equality).
- `Status = Constructed` (single `=`) appears only as the *value* of a
  `ConstructionStatusChangedMessage` — i.e., shorthand for "the message whose `Status`
  field equals `Constructed`".

Type and method names follow the spec convention (PascalCase for types/properties/builder
methods; lowercase for primitive operations like `construct()` / `select()`). Each
language flavor adapts to its native conventions per ADR-0006.

Where pseudo-lambdas appear in Given/When/Then (e.g., `m => …`), they are illustrative —
each language flavor uses its native syntax.

## 3. Lifecycle (`LIFE-NNN`)

### LIFE-001 — construct from Destructed transitions through Constructing to Constructed

**Given** a freshly built VM in state `Destructed`
**And** a subscriber to the hub filtered on `ConstructionStatusChangedMessage`
**When** `construct()` is called
**Then** the subscriber observes exactly two messages, with `Status` values
`Constructing` then `Constructed` in that order
**And** `vm.IsConstructed` is true after `construct()` returns

### LIFE-002 — destruct from Constructed transitions through Destructing to Destructed

**Given** a VM in state `Constructed`
**And** a subscriber filtered on `ConstructionStatusChangedMessage`
**When** `destruct()` is called
**Then** the subscriber observes exactly two messages with `Status` values
`Destructing` then `Destructed`
**And** `vm.IsConstructed` is false after `destruct()` returns

### LIFE-003 — reconstruct emits the full Destruct then Construct sequence

**Given** a VM in state `Constructed`
**And** a subscriber filtered on `ConstructionStatusChangedMessage`
**When** `reconstruct()` is called
**Then** the subscriber observes exactly four messages with `Status` values
`Destructing`, `Destructed`, `Constructing`, `Constructed`, in that order

### LIFE-004 — dispose transitions to Disposed from any state

**Given** a VM in any state ∈ `{Destructed, Constructing, Constructed, Destructing}`
**When** `dispose()` is called
**Then** `vm.Status` equals `Disposed`
**And** a `ConstructionStatusChangedMessage` with `Status = Disposed` is observed
on the hub

### LIFE-005 — construct from Disposed raises

**Given** a VM in state `Disposed`
**When** `construct()` is called
**Then** a `StatusTransitionError` / `StatusTransitionException` is raised
**And** the exception message contains the current state ("Disposed") and the
attempted operation ("construct")

### LIFE-006 — destruct from Disposed raises

**Given** a VM in state `Disposed`
**When** `destruct()` is called
**Then** a `StatusTransitionError` / `StatusTransitionException` is raised
**And** the exception message contains the current state ("Disposed") and the
attempted operation ("destruct")

### LIFE-007 — IsConstructed equals Status == Constructed

**Given** a VM in any state
**When** `vm.IsConstructed` is read
**Then** the value equals `(vm.Status == Constructed)`

### LIFE-008 — Concurrent operation while transitioning raises

**Given** a VM whose `construct()` or `destruct()` is in progress (state `Constructing` or
`Destructing`, has not yet reached the corresponding terminal state)
**When** the same operation is invoked again concurrently
**Then** the second call raises `StatusTransitionError` / `StatusTransitionException`

### LIFE-009 — construct from Constructed is idempotent (no-op)

**Given** a VM in state `Constructed`
**And** a subscriber filtered on `ConstructionStatusChangedMessage`
**When** `construct()` is called
**Then** the subscriber observes NO new messages
**And** `vm.Status` remains `Constructed`

### LIFE-010 — destruct from Destructed is idempotent (no-op)

**Given** a VM in state `Destructed`
**And** a subscriber filtered on `ConstructionStatusChangedMessage`
**When** `destruct()` is called
**Then** the subscriber observes NO new messages
**And** `vm.Status` remains `Destructed`

### LIFE-011 — Lifecycle transition table matches fixture

**Given** the JSON fixture `spec/fixtures/lifecycle-transitions.json`
**When** each row is exercised against a freshly-built VM, where rows with `from == Constructing`
or `from == Destructing` are reached by starting an asynchronous `construct()` or `destruct()`
and pausing the dispatcher mid-transition (e.g., via a test scheduler or controllable hook)
**Then** rows with `legal: true` complete with the expected `to_final` state
**And** rows with `legal: false` raise `StatusTransitionError` / `StatusTransitionException`
**And** the fixture's `to_intermediate` field captures only the first transient state of
non-trivial transitions; the full `reconstruct` sequence is normatively defined in
`02-lifecycle.md` and tested by LIFE-003

### LIFE-012 — dispose from Disposed emits no message

**Given** a VM in state `Disposed`
**And** a subscriber filtered on `ConstructionStatusChangedMessage`
**When** `dispose()` is called
**Then** the subscriber observes NO new messages
**And** `vm.Status` remains `Disposed`

### LIFE-013 — dispose on a parent disposes every child depth-first

**Given** a container VM (`CompositeVM<VM>`, `GroupVM<VM>`, or `AggregateVMN<…>`)
in `Constructed` state with all children/component slots themselves `Constructed`,
each child itself a container with grand-children all `Constructed`
**When** `parent.dispose()` is called
**Then** when it returns, every child and every grand-child has `Status == Disposed`
**And** the disposal order is depth-first (grand-children before children before parent)

### LIFE-014 — A throwing construct/destruct hook rolls Status back (transactional)

**Given** a VM whose `OnConstruct` (`_on_construct` / `_onConstruct`) hook raises
**When** `construct()` is called
**Then** the call propagates the hook's exception
**And** `vm.Status` is `Destructed` (rolled back from the transient `Constructing`),
not `Constructing`
**And** the VM is recoverable: a subsequent `construct()` with a non-throwing hook
reaches `Constructed`
**And** symmetrically, for a VM in `Constructed` whose `OnDestruct` hook raises,
`destruct()` propagates the exception, `vm.Status` rolls back to `Constructed`
(not `Destructing`), and a subsequent `destruct()` with a non-throwing hook reaches
`Destructed`

> Normatively defined in `02-lifecycle.md §2.4`.

## 4. Message hub (`HUB-NNN`)

### HUB-001 — Send delivers to current subscribers

**Given** an `IMessageHub` with one subscriber to `hub.Messages`
**When** `hub.Send(message)` is called
**Then** the subscriber receives `message` synchronously before `Send` returns

### HUB-002 — Late subscribers do not see prior messages

**Given** an `IMessageHub`
**When** `hub.Send(messageA)` is called
**And** a subscriber subscribes to `hub.Messages`
**And** `hub.Send(messageB)` is called
**Then** the subscriber observes only `messageB`

### HUB-003 — Single-producer FIFO order

**Given** an `IMessageHub` with one subscriber
**When** the producer calls `hub.Send(A)`, `hub.Send(B)`, `hub.Send(C)` from the
same thread in that order
**Then** the subscriber observes `A`, `B`, `C` in that order

### HUB-004 — Subscriber dispose during emit does not crash

**Given** an `IMessageHub` with one subscriber whose handler disposes the
subscription on the first message
**When** `hub.Send(A)` then `hub.Send(B)`
**Then** the subscriber observes only `A`
**And** no exception is raised by the hub

### HUB-005 — Multiple subscribers each observe every post-subscribe message

**Given** an `IMessageHub` with N subscribers (N ≥ 2)
**When** the producer calls `hub.Send(message)` once
**Then** every subscriber observes `message` exactly once

### HUB-006 — Hub matches message-ordering fixture

**Given** the JSON fixture `spec/fixtures/message-ordering.json`
**When** every scenario in the fixture is exercised against a fresh hub
**Then** the observed messages match each scenario's expected-output field:

- single-subscriber scenarios use `expected_observed` (a list of message identifiers)
- the `multiple-subscribers-same-message` scenario uses `expected_observed_per_subscriber`
  (each of the `subscriber_count` subscribers observes that same list)
- the `unsubscribe-during-emit` scenario uses `expected_observed` (the surviving
  subscription's observed list)

### HUB-007 — Subscriber handler that raises does not break the hub

**Given** an `IMessageHub` with subscriber A whose handler raises on every message
**And** subscriber B whose handler records every message
**When** `hub.Send(message1)` then `hub.Send(message2)` is called
**Then** subscriber B observes both `message1` and `message2`
**And** no exception propagates to the caller of `Send`

______________________________________________________________________

## 5. Property change (`PROP-NNN`)

### PROP-001 — Setting a property to a different value publishes PropertyChangedMessage

**Given** a modeled `ComponentVM<M>` with `Model = m1`
**And** a subscriber filtered on `PropertyChangedMessage`
**When** `vm.Model = m2` where `m2 != m1`
**Then** the subscriber observes exactly one `PropertyChangedMessage` with
`PropertyName = "Model"` and `Sender = vm`

### PROP-002 — Setting a property to the same value does NOT publish

**Given** a modeled `ComponentVM<M>` with `Model = m1`
**And** a subscriber filtered on `PropertyChangedMessage`
**When** `vm.Model = m1` (same instance)
**Then** the subscriber observes zero `PropertyChangedMessage` emissions

### PROP-003 — Sender identity equals the VM instance

**Given** a modeled `ComponentVM<M>` named "vm1"
**And** a subscriber filtered on `PropertyChangedMessage`
**When** `vm.Model = m2`
**Then** the observed message's `Sender` is identical to (referentially equal to)
the `vm` instance

### PROP-004 — PropertyName equals the property's name

**Given** a modeled `ComponentVM<M>` with `Name = "n1"`
**And** a subscriber filtered on `PropertyChangedMessage`
**When** `vm.Model = m2`
**Then** the observed message's `PropertyName` is exactly `"Model"`
**And** the message's `SenderName` is `"n1"`

______________________________________________________________________

## 6. Commands (`CMD-NNN`)

### CMD-001 — execute invokes the configured task

**Given** a `RelayCommand` built with `.Task(t)` where `t` is a no-op recorder
**When** `command.Execute()` is called
**Then** `t` is invoked exactly once

### CMD-002 — can_execute with no predicate returns true

**Given** a `RelayCommand` built without `.Predicate(...)`
**When** `command.CanExecute()` is called
**Then** it returns `true`

### CMD-003 — can_execute returns the predicate result

**Given** a `RelayCommand` built with `.Predicate(() => false)`
**When** `command.CanExecute()` is called
**Then** it returns `false`

### CMD-004 — Trigger emission fires CanExecuteChanged

**Given** a `RelayCommand` built with a single trigger `Subject<Unit>`
**And** a subscriber to `CanExecuteChanged`
**When** the trigger emits one `Unit`
**Then** the subscriber observes exactly one `CanExecuteChanged` fire

### CMD-005 — Parameterized variant passes parameter

**Given** a `RelayCommand<int>` built with `.Task(p => recorder.Record(p))`
**When** `command.Execute(42)` is called
**Then** the recorder receives the value `42`

### CMD-006 — execute with null task is a no-op

**Given** a `RelayCommand` built without `.Task(...)`
**When** `command.Execute()` is called
**Then** no exception is raised
**And** no observable side effect occurs

### CMD-007 — Command truth-table matches fixture

**Given** the JSON fixture `spec/fixtures/command-truthtable.json`
**When** every row is exercised against a freshly built `RelayCommand`
**Then** the row's expected `can_execute`, `execute_invokes_task`, and
`can_execute_changed_fires` results all hold

### CMD-008 — `Confirm(delegate)` is equivalent to explicit `ConfirmationDecoratorCommand`

**Given** an `ICommand` `cmd`
**And** a `confirm` delegate of shape `() -> Task<bool>`
**When** `cmd.Confirm(confirm)` is called
**Then** the returned command's `CanExecute` and `Execute` graph is identical to
`new ConfirmationDecoratorCommand(cmd, confirm)` — i.e., `CanExecute` delegates to
`cmd.CanExecute`, and `Execute` invokes `confirm()` then `cmd.Execute()` only when
`confirm` resolves to `true`

### CMD-009 — `PrecedeWith(other)` is equivalent to `CompositeCommand(other, receiver)`

**Given** two commands `cmd` and `other`
**When** `cmd.PrecedeWith(other)` is called
**Then** the returned command is equivalent to `new CompositeCommand(other, cmd)` —
i.e., `other.Execute()` is invoked before `cmd.Execute()` when both are executable

### CMD-010 — `SucceedWith(other)` is equivalent to `CompositeCommand(receiver, other)`

**Given** two commands `cmd` and `other`
**When** `cmd.SucceedWith(other)` is called
**Then** the returned command is equivalent to `new CompositeCommand(cmd, other)` —
i.e., `cmd.Execute()` is invoked before `other.Execute()` when both are executable

### CMD-011 — `WrapWith(predicate?, pre?, post?)` is equivalent to explicit `DecoratorCommand`

**Given** an `ICommand` `cmd`
**And** optional extra predicate, pre-action, and post-action arguments
**When** `cmd.WrapWith(predicate, pre, post)` is called
**Then** the returned command is equivalent to
`new DecoratorCommand(cmd, pre, post, predicate)` (the shipped C# / Python
constructor takes `(inner, preExecute, postExecute, extraPredicate)`) —
including the case where all three arguments are null/absent, which yields a
transparent decorator

### CMD-012 — `AsyncRelayCommand.Cancel()` cancels an in-flight async task, non-throwing by default

**Given** an `AsyncRelayCommand` built with a long-running cancellable async task
**And** the task has started (an execution is in flight)
**When** `command.Cancel()` is called and the awaited `ExecuteAsync` completes
**Then** the awaited execution completes **without** surfacing a cancellation
exception (non-throwing default, aligned with `DIA-007`)
**And** the command returns to a non-executing state — `IsExecuting` is `false`
and `CanExecute` returns `true`
**And** while the task was in flight `CanExecute` returned `false` (the command
cannot double-run)

> Spec: `04-commands.md §10`, ADR-0056. Full-parity (C#/Python/TypeScript) only —
> Swift does not ship `AsyncRelayCommand` (ADR-0037 subset).

### CMD-013 — disposed relay commands are inert

**Given** a `RelayCommand` or parameterized `RelayCommand<T>` built with a task
**And** the command has been disposed
**When** `CanExecute` is queried
**Then** it returns `false`
**And when** `Execute` is invoked
**Then** the configured task is not invoked and no exception is raised

> Spec: `04-commands.md §5`, ADR-0068.

**And** `vm.IsConstructed` is true after the call

### CVM-002 — Modeled component fires PropertyChanged("Model") on set

**Given** a modeled `ComponentVM<M>` with `Model = m1`
**And** a subscriber filtered on `PropertyChangedMessage`

### CVM-003 — ReadonlyComponentVM has no Model setter

**Given** a `ReadonlyComponentVM<M>` built with `Model(m1)`
**When** the API surface of the VM is inspected
**Then** there is no public way to set `Model` (no setter property, no method)
**And** `vm.Model == m1`

### CVM-004 — ModeledHint recomputes when Model changes

**Given** a modeled `ComponentVM<M>` built with a `ModeledHinter` that returns `"hint:" + m.Id`
**And** `Model = m1` where `m1.Id == 7`
**When** `vm.Model = m2` where `m2.Id == 8`
**Then** `vm.ModeledHint == "hint:8"`
**And** a `PropertyChangedMessage("ModeledHint")` is observed on the hub

### CVM-005 — Name and Hint are immutable post-construction

**Given** a `ComponentVM<M>` built with `Name("orig")` and `Hint("h")`
**When** the API surface is inspected
**Then** there is no public setter for `Name` or `Hint`
**And** `vm.Name == "orig"` and `vm.Hint == "h"` for the VM's lifetime

### CVM-006 — SelectCommand can_execute reflects selection state

**Given** a `ComponentVM<M>` in `Constructed` state whose parent has `Current = null`
**When** `SelectCommand.CanExecute()` is called
**Then** it returns `true`
**And** after `vm.select()`, `SelectCommand.CanExecute()` returns `false`

______________________________________________________________________

## 8. CompositeVM (`COMP-NNN`)

### COMP-001 — Add emits CollectionChanged(action=Add)

**Given** an empty `CompositeVM<VM>` in `Constructed` state

### COMP-004 — Construct waits until all children reach Constructed

**Given** a `CompositeVM<VM>` in `Destructed` state with N children all in
`Destructed`
**When** `composite.construct()` is called
**Then** when it returns (or its awaiter resumes), every child has `Status == Constructed`

### COMP-005 — Destruct waits until all children reach Destructed

**Given** a `CompositeVM<VM>` in `Constructed` state with N children all in
`Constructed` and `Current = c0`
**When** `composite.destruct()` is called
**Then** when it returns, `composite.Current == null`
**And** every child has `Status == Destructed`
**And** the composite has `Status == Destructed`

### COMP-006 — IsCurrent change on the previously-Current child dispatches on foreground

**Given** a `CompositeVM<VM>` in `Constructed` state with children `[vmA, vmB]` and
`Current = vmA`, built with a dispatcher whose `Foreground` is a `TestScheduler`-equivalent
**And** a subscriber to `PropertyChangedMessage("IsCurrent")` filtered on `Sender == vmA`,
using `ObserveOn(dispatcher.Foreground)`
**When** `composite.Current = vmB` (or `composite.deselect_component(vmA)`)
**Then** the subscriber's handler is invoked on the foreground scheduler with `vmA` as sender

### COMP-007 — Modeled composite maps model factory output to children

**Given** a `CompositeVM<M, VM>` built with `ChildrenModels(() => [m1, m2])` and
`ChildModelToChildViewModel(m => MakeVM(m))`

**And** the composite contains `vmA` and `Current == null`
**When** `composite.select_component(vmA)` is called
**Then** `composite.Current` does NOT change synchronously
**And** advancing the test scheduler completes the dispatch, making `composite.Current == vmA`
**And** subsequent subscribers to `PropertyChangedMessage("Current")` observe on the foreground scheduler

### COMP-011 — deselect_component raises when vm is not Current

**Given** a `CompositeVM<VM>` containing `vmA` and `vmB`, with `Current == vmA`

**And** `child` is a fresh `IComponentVM` in `Destructed` state
**And** a subscriber to `CollectionChanged`

**Then** `child.Status == Constructed` BEFORE the `CollectionChanged(Add)` event is observed
**And** when the subscriber receives the event, the child reads as `Constructed`

### COMP-013 — BatchUpdate suppresses per-mutation events and emits one Reset (spec v1.1)

**Given** a `CompositeVM<VM>` in `Constructed` state
**And** a subscriber to `CollectionChanged`
**When** `composite.BatchUpdate()` is entered as `using`/`with`

### GRP-002 — Group lacks child-navigation and child-selection members

**Given** a `GroupVM<VM>` instance
**When** the API surface is inspected
**Then** there is no `Current` property
**And** there is no `select_component`, `deselect_component`, or `can_select_component` method
**And** `SelectCommand` and `DeselectCommand` ARE present (they operate on the group's own
selection within its parent, not on the children — see `07-group-vm.md`)
**And** `SelectNextCommand` and `SelectPreviousCommand` ARE present (inherited from
the `IComponentVM` baseline) but their predicates always return `false`, since the group
exposes no internal navigation slot

**Given** a `GroupVM<VM>` built with `.AutoConstructOnAdd(true)` and already in `Constructed` state
**And** `child` is a fresh `IComponentVM` in `Destructed` state
**And** a subscriber to `CollectionChanged`

**Then** `child.Status == Constructed` BEFORE the `CollectionChanged(Add)` event is observed

### GRP-006 — BatchUpdate suppresses per-mutation events and emits one Reset (spec v1.1)

**Given** a `GroupVM<VM>` in `Constructed` state
**And** a subscriber to `CollectionChanged`
**When** `group.BatchUpdate()` is entered as `using`/`with`
**And** N (≥1) mutations are applied (Add / Insert / Remove / Clear)

**Given** an `AggregateVM5<VM1..VM5>` in `Destructed`
**And** a subscriber filtered on `ConstructionStatusChangedMessage` where

ONLY AFTER every `ComponentI.Status` has reached `Constructed`

### AGG-004 — ComponentN property change fires on construct

**Given** an `AggregateVM3<VM1, VM2, VM3>` in `Destructed`
**And** a subscriber filtered on `PropertyChangedMessage`
**When** `agg.construct()` is called
**Then** three `PropertyChangedMessage` events with `PropertyName ∈ {"Component1", "Component2", "Component3"}` are observed

### AGG-005 — Destruction waits for all children Destructed

**Given** an `AggregateVM2<VM1, VM2>` in `Constructed`
**When** `agg.destruct()` is called
**Then** when it returns, `agg.Component1.Status == Destructed` AND
`agg.Component2.Status == Destructed`
**And** `agg.Status == Destructed`

### AGG-006 — Arity-6 all six components reach Constructed; destruction waits for all

**Given** a concrete no-op subclass of `ForwardingComponentVM<M>` wrapping `inner` (no member overridden)
**When** each public member of the forwarding VM is read or invoked
**Then** the result equals the value/effect of the same member on `inner`

### FWD-002 — Selective override replaces a single behavior

**Given** a subclass of `ForwardingComponentVM<M>` that overrides `Hint` to return
`"OVERRIDE"`
**And** the wrapped VM has `Hint == "inner-hint"`

**Then** `vmA` and `vmB` are different instances
**And** `vmA.Name == vmB.Name`, `vmA.Hint == vmB.Hint`, `vmA.Type == vmB.Type`,
and (for modeled variants) `vmA.Model == vmB.Model`

### BLD-004 — Field defaults applied when not set

**Given** a builder configured with only the required fields
**When** `.Build()` is called
**Then** `vm.Hint == ""`, `vm.Parent == null`, `vm.Type ==` the type derived from
the VM class

### BLD-005 — Additive setters retain prior values across repeated calls

**Given** a `RelayCommand.Builder()` `b1`
**And** two distinct observables `o1` and `o2`
**When** `b2 = b1.Triggers(o1)` and `b3 = b2.Triggers(o2)` are called

**And** the order matches insertion order (`o1` precedes `o2`)
**And** other (non-additive) setters such as `Name` and `Task` continue to overwrite
on repeated calls per BLD-001's standard semantics

```
root: CompositeVM
  ├── a: ComponentVM
  └── b: CompositeVM
        ├── b1: ComponentVM
        └── b2: ComponentVM
```

**When** `list(walk(root))` is materialized
**Then** the sequence is `[root, a, b, b1, b2]`

### UTIL-002 — walk skips empty aggregate slots

**Given** an `AggregateVM3` with `Component1` populated, `Component2 == null`, `Component3` populated
**When** `list(walk(agg))` is materialized
**Then** the sequence contains `agg`, `agg.Component1`, `agg.Component3`

**When** the flavor's public surface is inspected
**Then** each contract has a paired null variant (`NullMessageHub`,
`NullDispatcher`) reachable from the public surface
**And** the null variant satisfies the contract (its operations are total —
they do not raise on any input)

______________________________________________________________________

## 17. Derived properties (`DPROP-NNN`) — spec v2.0

Each DPROP-NNN test verifies the `DerivedProperty<TValue>` contract from
spec/15-derived-properties.md.

### DPROP-001 — Single-source derived value computes on construction

**Given** a single source observable `s1` whose latest value is `10`
**And** a `DerivedProperty<int>` built from `s1` with transform `x => x * 2`
**When** `Value` is read after the derived property is constructed
**Then** `Value == 20`

### DPROP-002 — Source change triggers recompute

**Given** a `DerivedProperty<int>` built from source `s1` (initial `10`) with
transform `x => x * 2`
**When** `s1` emits the value `5`
**Then** `Value == 10`

### DPROP-003 — Two-source derived value

**Given** sources `s1` (initial `3`) and `s2` (initial `4`)
**And** a `DerivedProperty<int>` built from `(s1, s2)` with transform `(a, b) => a + b`
**When** `Value` is read after construction
**Then** `Value == 7`
**When** `s2` emits `6`
**Then** `Value == 9`

### DPROP-004 — Five-source derived value (spec minimum)

**Given** sources `s1..s5` with initial values `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`
**And** a `DerivedProperty<int>` built from all five with transform `sum`
**When** `Value` is read after construction
**Then** `Value == 15`

### DPROP-005 — Mutation of any source recomputes

**Given** the five-source setup from DPROP-004
**When** `s3` emits the value `30`
**Then** `Value == 1 + 2 + 30 + 4 + 5 == 42`

### DPROP-006 — Default-built derived property is read-only

**Given** a `DerivedProperty<int>` built without a validator or write-back
**When** `CanSet(any_value)` is queried
**Then** the result is `false` for every input

### DPROP-007 — Validator + write-back enables SetValue

**Given** a `DerivedProperty<int>` built with validator `v => v > 0` and a
recording write-back action
**When** `SetValue(5)` is called
**Then** the write-back action records `5`
**And** when `SetValue(-1)` is called, the operation raises and the write-back
is NOT invoked

### DPROP-008 — Write-back action receives the value

**Given** a `DerivedProperty<int>` built with validator `_ => true` and
write-back action `v => recorder.Add(v)`
**When** `SetValue(7)` is called
**Then** the recorder has exactly one entry, equal to `7`

### DPROP-009 — ValueChanged emits on recompute

**Given** a `DerivedProperty<int>` from `s1` (initial `1`) and a subscriber
to `ValueChanged`
**When** `s1` emits `2`, then `3`
**Then** the subscriber observes the sequence `[2, 3]`
**And** the subscriber did NOT observe the initial value as an emission
(only post-construction changes count)

### DPROP-010 — ValueChanged does not emit when transform output is unchanged

**Given** a `DerivedProperty<int>` from `(s1, s2)` with transform `(a, b) => a + b`
and a subscriber to `ValueChanged`
**And** initial values `s1=5, s2=5` so `Value == 10`
**When** `s1` emits `3` (so the transform produces `3 + 5 == 8`) then `s2` emits `7`
(so the transform produces `3 + 7 == 10` again)
**Then** the subscriber observes exactly `[8, 10]` — the second mutation
re-produces `10` and is not suppressed because the previous value was `8`
**When** continuing with `s1` emits `3` again (same source value)
**Then** no additional emission (transform output stays `10`)

### DPROP-011 — Dispose ends subscriptions and ValueChanged completes

**Given** a `DerivedProperty<int>` from `s1` (initial `1`) with a subscriber
to `ValueChanged` that records completion
**When** the derived property's `Dispose` is called
**Then** the subscriber's `complete` (or equivalent) callback is invoked
**And** subsequent emissions from `s1` do NOT update `Value` further

### DPROP-012 — Derived-property scenarios match fixture

**Given** the JSON fixture `spec/fixtures/derived-properties.json`
**When** each scenario is exercised — initial values populate sources, the
named transform is resolved, and the mutation sequence is replayed
**Then** the sequence of `Value` reads (one initial, one after each mutation)
matches `expected_values` exactly

**Given** a `CompositeCommand` aggregating `c1` (`CanExecute() == true`, records),
`c2` (`CanExecute() == false`, records), and `c3` (`CanExecute() == true`, records)
**When** `composite.Execute()` is called

**And** `c2` records zero invocations

### CMDD-003 — CompositeCommand propagates inner CanExecuteChanged

**Given** a `CompositeCommand` aggregating `c1` with a trigger, and a subscriber to
the composite's `CanExecuteChanged`

**Given** a `DecoratorCommand` wrapping `inner` (`CanExecute() == true`) with extra
predicate returning `false`

**Then** the result is `false`
**And** when the extra predicate returns `true`, the result is `true`
**And** when `inner.CanExecute()` is `false`, the result is `false` regardless of
the extra predicate

### CMDD-005 — DecoratorCommand.Execute invokes pre, inner, post in order

**Given** a `DecoratorCommand` wrapping `inner` (records) with pre-action `pre`
(records) and post-action `post` (records)
**When** `decorator.Execute()` is called (and `CanExecute` is true)
**Then** the recorded order is `[pre, inner, post]`

### CMDD-006 — DecoratorCommand.Execute is no-op when CanExecute is false

**Given** a `DecoratorCommand` wrapping `inner` (records) with extra predicate
returning `false`
**When** `decorator.Execute()` is called
**Then** `inner`, `pre`, and `post` all record zero invocations

### CMDD-007 — ConfirmationDecoratorCommand invokes inner only when confirmed

**Given** a `ConfirmationDecoratorCommand` wrapping `inner` (records) with a confirm
delegate that resolves `true`
**When** `decorator.Execute()` is called and the resulting task is awaited
**Then** `inner` records one invocation
**And** when the confirm delegate resolves `false`, `inner` records zero invocations

### CMDD-008 — ConfirmationDecoratorCommand.CanExecute delegates to inner

**Given** a `ConfirmationDecoratorCommand` wrapping `inner` with no extra gating
**When** `decorator.CanExecute()` is called
**Then** the result equals `inner.CanExecute()` for any state of `inner`

### CMDD-009 — Decorators compose (decorator of confirmation of relay)

**Given** a `RelayCommand` `relay` (records) wrapped by `ConfirmationDecoratorCommand`
`conf` (confirm returns `true`) wrapped by `DecoratorCommand` `dec` (no pre/post,
no extra predicate)
**When** `dec.Execute()` is called and awaited
**Then** `relay` records exactly one invocation

### CMDD-010 — ConfirmationDecoratorCommand surfaces fire-and-forget errors on `errors`

Per spec/04-commands.md §8.3.1 and ADR-0049. Full-parity in every flavor that
ships `ConfirmationDecoratorCommand` (C#, Python, TypeScript); Swift does not
ship the command decorators.

**Given** a `ConfirmationDecoratorCommand` wrapping `inner`, and a subscriber to its
`errors` observable
**When** the fire-and-forget `Execute()` runs with a `confirm` delegate that
rejects/raises
**Then** the subscriber observes that exception on `errors` (it is NOT swallowed)
**And** when instead `confirm` resolves `true` and `inner.Execute()` throws, the
subscriber observes the inner exception on `errors`

## 19. Notification sub-package (`NOTIF-NNN`) — spec v2.0 / v2.1

Each NOTIF-NNN test verifies the `INotificationHub` contract from
spec/16-notifications.md and ADR-0013.

### NOTIF-001 — Post returns an awaitable that completes when Resolve is called

**Given** a `NotificationHub` instance and a notification
`n = Notification(Notification, "info")`
**When** `task = hub.Post(n)` is called, then `hub.Resolve(n, Approve)` is called
**Then** awaiting `task` yields `Approve`

### NOTIF-002 — Post adds the notification to Pending

**Given** a `NotificationHub` with a subscriber to `Pending`
**When** `hub.Post(n)` is called
**Then** the subscriber observes a new `Pending` snapshot whose contents include `n`

### NOTIF-003 — Resolve removes the notification from Pending

**Given** a `NotificationHub` with `n` posted and pending
**And** a subscriber to `Pending` that captures every snapshot
**When** `hub.Resolve(n, Approve)` is called
**Then** the final observed `Pending` snapshot does NOT include `n`

### NOTIF-004 — NotificationType has Error / Notification / Confirmation values

**Given** the `NotificationType` enum
**When** its values are enumerated
**Then** the set is exactly `{Error, Notification, Confirmation}`

### NOTIF-005 — NotificationReaction has Pending / Approve / Reject values

**Given** the `NotificationReaction` enum
**When** its values are enumerated
**Then** the set is exactly `{Pending, Approve, Reject}`

### NOTIF-006 — The resolved task carries the reaction value

**Given** a `NotificationHub` with `n` posted and `task = hub.Post(n)`
**When** `hub.Resolve(n, Reject)` is called
**Then** awaiting `task` yields `Reject`

### NOTIF-007 — Confirmation notifications can be resolved Approve or Reject

**Given** a `NotificationHub`
**And** `nApprove = Notification(Confirmation, "x")` posted via `taskA = hub.Post(nApprove)`
**And** `nReject  = Notification(Confirmation, "y")` posted via `taskR = hub.Post(nReject)`
**When** `hub.Resolve(nApprove, Approve)` and `hub.Resolve(nReject, Reject)`
**Then** `taskA` yields `Approve`
**And** `taskR` yields `Reject`

### NOTIF-008 — Resolving a notification not in Pending is a no-op

**Given** a `NotificationHub` and a fresh notification `n` that was never posted
**When** `hub.Resolve(n, Approve)` is called
**Then** no exception is raised
**And** `Pending` is unchanged

### NOTIF-009 — NullNotificationHub.Post resolves to Approve immediately

**Given** a `NullNotificationHub` instance and a notification
`n = Notification(Confirmation, "x")`
**When** `task = hub.Post(n)` is called
**Then** awaiting `task` yields `Approve`
**And** the wait completes immediately (does not block on user input)

### NOTIF-010 — make_confirm helper returns true iff resolved Approve

**Given** a `NotificationHub` and the helper `confirm = make_confirm(hub, "ok?")`
**When** the call `confirm()` is initiated and the next pending notification
is resolved Approve
**Then** awaiting `confirm()` yields `true`
**And** when the next pending notification is resolved Reject instead, awaiting
yields `false`

### NOTIF-011 — `NotificationVM` opacity decays linearly from 1.0 to 0.0 over `Lifespan` — spec v2.1

**Given** a `NotificationVM` with `Lifespan = 10 s` constructed under a `TestScheduler`
**When** `Opacity` is read at construction time
**Then** `Opacity` is `1.0`
**When** the scheduler is advanced by 5 s
**Then** `Opacity` is approximately `0.5` (±0.01)
**When** the scheduler is advanced to the full 10 s mark
**Then** `Opacity` is approximately `0.0` (±0.01)

### NOTIF-012 — `NotificationVM` auto-dismisses (resolves Approve) when `RemainingTime` reaches 0 — spec v2.1

**Given** a `NotificationVM` with `Lifespan = 5 s` under a `TestScheduler`
**And** the notification has been posted to a `NotificationHub`
**When** the scheduler is advanced by 5 s
**Then** `IsResolved` is `true`
**And** the hub notification is resolved with `NotificationReaction.Approve`

### NOTIF-013 — `ConfirmationVM` exposes `ApproveCommand` and `RejectCommand`; each resolves with the corresponding `NotificationReaction` — spec v2.1

**Given** a `ConfirmationVM` wrapping a posted notification
**When** `ApproveCommand.Execute()` is called
**Then** the hub notification is resolved with `NotificationReaction.Approve`
**And** `IsResolved` is `true`

**Given** a second `ConfirmationVM` wrapping a different posted notification
**When** `RejectCommand.Execute()` is called
**Then** the hub notification is resolved with `NotificationReaction.Reject`
**And** `IsResolved` is `true`

### NOTIF-014 — Manual `DismissCommand` cancels the lifespan timer; subsequent timer ticks have no effect — spec v2.1

**Given** a `NotificationVM` with `Lifespan = 10 s` under a `TestScheduler`
**And** the notification has been posted to a `NotificationHub`
**When** `DismissCommand.Execute()` is called at time 0
**And** the scheduler is advanced past the full 10 s lifespan
**Then** the hub notification is resolved exactly once (not twice)
**And** `IsResolved` is `true`

### NOTIF-015 — Hub-side `Resolve()` on the notification propagates to VM `IsResolved` state — spec v2.1

**Given** a `NotificationVM` wrapping a posted notification
**And** `IsResolved` is initially `false`
**When** `hub.Resolve(notification, NotificationReaction.Approve)` is called externally
(not through the VM's own commands)
**Then** `IsResolved` becomes `true`
**And** the lifespan timer is cancelled (no further auto-dismiss effects)

### NOTIF-016 — Deterministic behavior under injected `TestScheduler` / fake clock — spec v2.1

**Given** a `NotificationVM` with `Lifespan = L` under a `TestScheduler` starting at
virtual time 0
**When** the scheduler is advanced to exactly `L`
**Then** `RemainingTime` is 0
**And** `Opacity` is 0.0
**And** auto-dismiss fires exactly once
**And** no further effects occur when the scheduler advances beyond `L`

### NOTIF-017 — Hub dispose resolves in-flight waiters with `Pending` — spec v2.5.0

**Given** a `NotificationHub` with one or more posted-but-unresolved notifications
**When** the hub is disposed
**Then** every in-flight awaitable returned by `Post` resolves with
`NotificationReaction.Pending`
**And** the `Pending` observable completes
**And** a subsequent `Post` resolves immediately with `Pending` and does not enqueue
**And** a subsequent `Resolve` is a no-op
**And** disposing again is a no-op (idempotent)

## 20. CompositeVM search/filter, modeled CRUD & builder hooks (`COMP-014..026`)

Search/filter (COMP-014..018, see ADR-0014), modeled CRUD (COMP-019..024,
see ADR-0016), and builder hooks (COMP-025..026, see ADR-0042) additions to
chapter 06.

### COMP-014 — SearchableState defaults to empty search term

**Given** a `SearchableState` over a list of items
**When** `SearchTerm` is read after construction
**Then** the value is `""`
**And** `Filtered` initially emits every item (predicate matches everything)

### COMP-015 — Setting SearchTerm triggers a debounced recompute

**Given** a `SearchableState` over `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` with predicate
"case-insensitive substring match" and debounce 0 (no delay, for the test)
**And** a subscriber to `Filtered`
**When** `SearchTerm = "an"` is set
**Then** the subscriber observes a snapshot `["banana"]`

### COMP-016 — search() forces immediate recompute, bypassing debounce

**Given** a `SearchableState` over `["one", "two"]` with predicate "exact match"
and a large debounce (1 second)
**And** a subscriber to `Filtered`
**When** `SearchTerm = "two"` is set, then `search()` is called immediately
**Then** the subscriber observes a snapshot `["two"]` before the debounce window
elapses

### COMP-017 — Predicate is user-supplied

**Given** a `SearchableState` constructed with predicate
`(item, term) => item.length > term.length` over `["a", "bb", "ccc"]`
**When** `SearchTerm = "bb"` is set and `search()` is called
**Then** `Filtered` emits `["ccc"]`

### COMP-018 — Filtered recomputes when Items source changes

**Given** a `SearchableState` over an initial list `["one"]` with predicate
"any match" and a search term of `"x"`
**And** a subscriber to `Filtered`
**When** the items source is updated to `["one", "two"]` and the helper is
notified (via `search()` / explicit refresh)
**Then** the subscriber observes a snapshot containing two items

### COMP-019 — CreateNewCommand invokes create-new action

**Given** a `ModeledCrudCommands` built with a recording `create_new` action
**When** `CreateNewCommand.Execute()` is called
**Then** the recorder has exactly one invocation

### COMP-020 — UpdateCurrentCommand invokes update with current VM

**Given** a `ModeledCrudCommands` with `current` returning `vm1` and a
recording `update_current(vm)` action
**When** `UpdateCurrentCommand.Execute()` is called
**Then** the recorder records `vm1` once

### COMP-021 — UpdateCurrentCommand.CanExecute false when current is null

**Given** a `ModeledCrudCommands` with `current` returning `null`
**When** `UpdateCurrentCommand.CanExecute()` is called
**Then** the result is `false`

### COMP-022 — DeleteCurrentCommand invokes delete with current VM

**Given** a `ModeledCrudCommands` with `current = vm1` and a recording
`delete_current(vm)` action
**When** `DeleteCurrentCommand.Execute()` is called
**Then** the recorder records `vm1` once

### COMP-023 — DeleteCurrentCommand.CanExecute false when current is null

**Given** a `ModeledCrudCommands` with `current` returning `null`
**When** `DeleteCurrentCommand.CanExecute()` is called
**Then** the result is `false`

### COMP-024 — DeleteCurrentCommand confirm gate

**Given** a `ModeledCrudCommands` with `current = vm1`, a recording
`delete_current` action, and a confirm delegate that resolves `false`
**When** `DeleteCurrentCommand.Execute()` is awaited
**Then** the recorder is empty
**And** when the confirm delegate resolves `true`, the recorder records `vm1`

### COMP-025 — `Current(selector)` builder hook drives initial selection during construct

**Given** a `CompositeVM<VM>` built with three children `a`, `b`, `c` and
`.Current(xs => xs.Skip(1).First())` (idiomatic per flavor) in `Destructed` state
**When** `composite.construct()` is called
**Then** after `construct()` returns, `composite.Current == b`
**And** the selector ran exactly once, after every child reached `Constructed` and
before the composite reached `Constructed`
**And** when the same composite is instead built with `.Current(_ => null)`,
after `construct()` returns `composite.Current` is `null` and no
`PropertyChangedMessage("Current")` is published

### COMP-026 — `OnCurrentChanged(callback)` fires synchronously after each `Current` change

**Given** a `CompositeVM<VM>` built with three children `a`, `b`, `c` and
`.OnCurrentChanged(vm => observed.Add(vm))` where `observed` is an empty list
**And** the composite is in `Constructed` state with `Current == null`
**When** `composite.select_component(b)` then `composite.deselect_component(b)` are called
**Then** `observed` equals `[b, null]` (exactly two invocations)
**And** each invocation is observed after the corresponding
`PropertyChangedMessage("Current")` is published on the hub
**And** when the composite is instead built with both
`.Current(xs => xs.First())` and `.OnCurrentChanged(vm => observed.Add(vm))`,
after `construct()` returns `observed` equals `[a]` (exactly one invocation
from the initial-selector assignment)

### COMP-027 — Adding a child sets its `Parent`; removing clears it

**Given** a `Constructed` `CompositeVM<VM>` `composite` and a separately-built,
`Constructed` child `c` that has not yet been added to any container
**Then** `c.can_select()` is `false` (a VM with no `Parent` is not selectable)
**When** `composite.Add(c)` is called
**Then** `c.can_select()` is `true` (the container set `c`'s `Parent` to itself on add,
and `c` is `Constructed` and not yet `Current`)
**And** `c.select()` makes `composite.Current` equal `c` and `c.IsCurrent` `true`
(the predicate and `select()` delegate through the newly-wired `Parent`)
**When** `c.deselect()` then `composite.Remove(c)` are called
**Then** `c.can_select()` is `false` again (removal cleared `c`'s `Parent` to `null`)
**And** a subsequent `c.select()` is a no-op — `composite.Current` stays `null` —
because `c` no longer has a `Parent` to delegate to

### COMP-028 — FilteredCompositeVM visible projection

**Given** a source `CompositeVM<VM>` and a predicate
**When** a `FilteredCompositeVM<VM>` is created over the source
**Then** `Visible` contains only source children accepted by the predicate
**And** source order is preserved

### COMP-029 — FilteredCompositeVM visible count

**Given** a filtered composite view
**When** `VisibleCount` is queried
**Then** it equals the current visible projection length

### COMP-030 — FilteredCompositeVM current maps to visible domain

**Given** a filtered composite view with at least one visible item
**When** `Current` is set to a visible item
**Then** `Current` returns that same source child

### COMP-031 — predicate change recomputes projection

**Given** a filtered composite view
**When** its predicate is replaced
**Then** the visible projection is recomputed immediately

### COMP-032 — source mutation reconciles projection

**Given** a filtered composite view subscribed to its source composite
**When** the source composite is mutated
**Then** the visible projection is recomputed

### COMP-033 — filtered cursor policies

**Given** a filtered composite view whose current item becomes filtered out
**When** the cursor policy is snap-to-first
**Then** `Current` moves to the first visible item
**And when** the cursor policy is clear
**Then** `Current` becomes null

### COMP-034 — visible navigation

**Given** a filtered composite view with multiple visible items
**When** next and previous visible navigation methods are invoked
**Then** `Current` moves within the visible projection and clamps at bounds

### COMP-035 — filtered view disposal

**Given** a filtered composite view
**When** it is disposed
**Then** later source mutations no longer update that view

### COMP-036 — scored filter orders by score with stable ties

**Given** a scored filtered composite view
**When** scores are computed
**Then** items with null/absent scores are excluded
**And** remaining items are ordered by descending score
**And** equal scores preserve source order

### COMP-037 — scored filter can recompute ordering

**Given** a scored filtered composite view whose scorer reads external score state
**When** that score state changes and `RefreshScores()` is called
**Then** the visible projection is reordered from the latest scores

______________________________________________________________________

## 21. GroupVM v2.0 additions (`GRP-007..010`)

Search/filter additions to chapter 07. The helper is the same
`SearchableState<TItem>` documented for composites (see ADR-0014); group-context
tests verify the helper behaves identically when items are group children.

### GRP-007 — SearchableState defaults to empty search term (group context)

**Given** a `SearchableState` over a list of group children
**When** `SearchTerm` is read after construction
**Then** the value is `""`

### GRP-008 — Setting SearchTerm triggers debounced recompute (group context)

**Given** a `SearchableState` over `["x", "yx", "z"]` with predicate
"case-insensitive substring match" and debounce 0
**And** a subscriber to `Filtered`
**When** `SearchTerm = "x"` is set
**Then** the subscriber observes a snapshot `["x", "yx"]`

### GRP-009 — search() forces immediate recompute (group context)

**Given** a `SearchableState` with a large debounce
**When** `SearchTerm` is set then `search()` is called immediately
**Then** the subscriber observes the filtered snapshot before the debounce
window elapses

### GRP-010 — Predicate is user-supplied (group context)

**Given** a `SearchableState` with a custom predicate
**When** `SearchTerm` is set and `search()` is called
**Then** the filtered snapshot reflects the custom predicate's matches

______________________________________________________________________

## 22. Expand / collapse (`EXP-NNN`) — spec v2.0

Each EXP-NNN test verifies the `ExpandableState` helper and `walk_expanded`
tree traversal from spec/05-component-vm.md and spec/13-tree-utilities.md.

### EXP-001 — ExpandableState defaults to collapsed

**Given** a freshly built `ExpandableState`
**When** `IsExpanded` is read
**Then** the value is `false`
**And** `CanExpand()` returns `true`, `CanCollapse()` returns `false`

### EXP-002 — Expand flips state and emits IsExpandedChanged

**Given** an `ExpandableState` with `IsExpanded == false`
**And** a subscriber to `IsExpandedChanged`
**When** `Expand()` is called
**Then** `IsExpanded == true`
**And** the subscriber observes exactly one emission with value `true`
**And** subsequent `Expand()` calls are no-ops (`IsExpanded` stays `true`, no
additional emissions)

### EXP-003 — Collapse flips state back

**Given** an `ExpandableState` with `IsExpanded == true`
**And** a subscriber to `IsExpandedChanged`
**When** `Collapse()` is called
**Then** `IsExpanded == false`
**And** the subscriber observes exactly one emission with value `false`

### EXP-004 — ToggleExpansion alternates state

**Given** an `ExpandableState` with `IsExpanded == false`
**When** `ToggleExpansion()` is called twice
**Then** `IsExpanded == false`
**And** when called a third time, `IsExpanded == true`

### EXP-005 — walk_expanded skips descendants of collapsed nodes

**Given** a tree:

```
root: CompositeVM with IExpandable wrapper, expanded
  ├── a: ComponentVM (no IExpandable)
  └── b: CompositeVM with IExpandable wrapper, COLLAPSED
        ├── b1: ComponentVM
        └── b2: ComponentVM
```

**When** `list(walk_expanded(root))` is materialized
**Then** the sequence is `[root, a, b]` — b's children are NOT visited

______________________________________________________________________

## 23. Localization (`LOC-NNN`) — spec v2.0

Each LOC-NNN test verifies the `ILocalizer` contract and `NullLocalizer`
null-default from spec/17-localization.md.

### LOC-001 — ILocalizer.Localize returns a string

**Given** a concrete `ILocalizer` implementation that returns `"hello"` for
key `"greeting"`
**When** `localizer.Localize("greeting")` is called
**Then** the result is the string `"hello"`

### LOC-002 — NullLocalizer.Localize returns the key verbatim

**Given** a `NullLocalizer` instance
**When** `localizer.Localize("some-key")` is called
**Then** the result is `"some-key"` (the key is returned unchanged)
**And** `localizer.Localize("some-key", [arg1, arg2])` also returns
`"some-key"` (no formatting)

### LOC-003 — Custom localizer can be substituted

**Given** a fixture localizer that returns `"X:" + key` for every key
**When** the fixture localizer is used in place of the null variant
**Then** calling `Localize("foo")` returns `"X:foo"`
**And** the framework's `ILocalizer` contract accepts the fixture without
type errors

______________________________________________________________________

## 24. Collection primitives (`COL-NNN`) — spec v2.1

Each COL-NNN test verifies a collection primitive from `spec/21-collections.md`.
See ADR-0024 (`ServicedObservableCollection<T>`), ADR-0025 (`ObservableDictionary`),
ADR-0026 (`ObservableList<T>`), and ADR-0023 (`PagedComposition<TVM>`).

### COL-001 — `ServicedObservableCollection<T>` publishes to hub after local event on add

**Given** a `ServicedObservableCollection<T>` constructed with a hub
**And** a subscriber that records the order of local `CollectionChanged` and hub `CollectionChangedMessage` receipts
**When** an item is added
**Then** the local `CollectionChanged` event fires before the hub message is published
**And** the hub `CollectionChangedMessage` carries `Action == Add` and the correct `NewItems` and `Index`

### COL-002 — `ServicedObservableCollection<T>` publishes on remove and replace

**Given** a `ServicedObservableCollection<T>` constructed with a hub and containing items
**When** an item is removed, then another is replaced
**Then** each mutation publishes exactly one `CollectionChangedMessage` to the hub
**And** the `Action` field equals `Remove` for the removal and `Replace` for the replacement
**And** `OldItems` is populated for the removal and both `OldItems` / `NewItems` are populated for the replacement

### COL-003 — Null-hub fallback: no hub means no publication, no error

**Given** a `ServicedObservableCollection<T>` constructed with no hub (or an explicit null)
**When** items are added, removed, and replaced
**Then** all mutations complete without raising any exception
**And** local `CollectionChanged` events fire normally for each mutation
**And** no hub message is published (no hub is present)

### COL-004 — `ServicedObservableCollection<T>` does not marshal; fires on caller thread

**Given** a `ServicedObservableCollection<T>` with a hub
**And** a subscriber that records the thread ID of each hub `CollectionChangedMessage` receipt
**When** an item is added on thread T
**Then** the hub message is received on thread T
**And** no scheduler or dispatcher is involved in the delivery

### COL-005 — `ObservableList<T>` `ItemAdded` payload shape

**Given** an `ObservableList<T>` with a subscriber to `ItemAdded`
**When** `Add(item)` is called
**Then** `ItemAdded` emits exactly once with `item` equal to the added item
**And** the `index` in the payload equals the position at which the item was inserted (zero-based)

### COL-006 — `ObservableList<T>` `ItemRemoved` payload shape

**Given** an `ObservableList<T>` containing `[a, b, c]` with a subscriber to `ItemRemoved`
**When** `RemoveAt(1)` is called (removing `b`)
**Then** `ItemRemoved` emits with `item == b` and `index == 1` (position before removal)

### COL-007 — `ObservableList<T>` `ItemReplaced` payload shape

**Given** an `ObservableList<T>` containing `[a, b]` with a subscriber to `ItemReplaced`
**When** `Replace(0, c)` is called (replacing `a` with `c`)
**Then** `ItemReplaced` emits with `newItem == c`, `oldItem == a`, and `index == 0`

### COL-008 — `ObservableList<T>` `Count` / `PropertyChanged` ordering after add

**Given** an `ObservableList<T>` with a subscriber that records the sequence of `ItemAdded` and `PropertyChanged("Count")` events
**When** `Add(item)` is called
**Then** `ItemAdded` fires before `PropertyChanged("Count")`
**And** `Count` reflects the new value by the time `PropertyChanged("Count")` fires

### COL-009 — `ObservableList<T>` batch suppression: only `Reset` fires inside `BatchUpdate`

**Given** a VM with an `ObservableList<T>` and a subscriber recording `ItemAdded`, `ItemRemoved`, and `Reset` events
**When** a `BatchUpdate()` scope is entered and three items are added and one removed inside the batch
**Then** no `ItemAdded` or `ItemRemoved` events fire during the batch
**And** exactly one `Reset` event fires when the batch completes

### COL-010 — `ObservableDictionary` insert and retrieve

**Given** an `ObservableDictionary<TKey1, TKey2, TValue>` (empty)
**When** `Add(k1, k2, v)` is called
**Then** `ContainsKey(k1, k2)` returns true
**And** the indexer `[k1, k2]` returns `v`
**And** `Count == 1`

### COL-011 — `ObservableDictionary` remove

**Given** an `ObservableDictionary` containing `(k1, k2) → v`
**When** `Remove(k1, k2)` is called
**Then** `ContainsKey(k1, k2)` returns false
**And** `Count == 0`

### COL-012 — `ObservableDictionary` replace

**Given** an `ObservableDictionary` containing `(k1, k2) → v1`
**When** the entry is replaced with `v2` (via indexer or `Add` after remove)
**Then** `[k1, k2]` returns `v2`
**And** `Count` remains unchanged

### COL-013 — `ObservableDictionary` distinct-key observable views stay in sync

**Given** an `ObservableDictionary<string, int, string>` with subscribers to `Keys1` (`ItemAdded`, `ItemRemoved`) and `Keys2`
**When** `Add("a", 1, "x")` then `Add("a", 2, "y")` then `Remove("a", 1)` are called
**Then** `Keys1` contains `["a"]` (only one entry; "a" appeared once and survives while any (a,?) entry exists)
**And** `Keys2` contains `[2]` (1 was removed because no other entry uses key2=1)

### COL-014 — `ObservableDictionary` enumeration order is insertion order

**Given** an `ObservableDictionary` with entries inserted in order `(k1, k2a)`, `(k2, k2b)`, `(k3, k2c)`
**When** the dictionary is enumerated
**Then** entries appear in insertion order: `(k1, k2a)`, `(k2, k2b)`, `(k3, k2c)`

### COL-015 — `ObservableDictionary` clear empties keys views

**Given** an `ObservableDictionary` containing multiple entries and subscribers to `Keys1` and `Keys2`
**When** `Clear()` is called
**Then** `Count == 0`
**And** `Keys1` and `Keys2` are both empty
**And** `Keys1` and `Keys2` each emitted the appropriate removal events

### COL-016 — `PagedComposition<TVM>` clamps `CurrentPageIndex` when source shrinks

**Given** a `PagedComposition<TVM>` wrapping a 10-item source with `PageSize == 3` and `CurrentPageIndex == 2` (last page)
**When** items are removed from the source until 4 items remain (2 full pages)
**Then** `PageCount == 2`
**And** `CurrentPageIndex` is clamped to `1` (the new upper bound)

### COL-017 — `PagedComposition<TVM>` `PageCount` derivation under add and remove

**Given** a `PagedComposition<TVM>` wrapping a source with `PageSize == 5`
**When** the source starts empty, then 5 items are added, then 1 more is added
**Then** `PageCount` transitions: `0` → `1` → `2`
**And** when 1 item is removed, `PageCount` drops back to `1`

### COL-018 — `PagedComposition<TVM>` navigation no-ops at bounds

**Given** a `PagedComposition<TVM>` with `PageSize == 3` over an 8-item source (`PageCount == 3`)
**When** `move_to_first_page()` is called while `CurrentPageIndex == 0`
**Then** `CurrentPageIndex` remains `0`
**When** `move_to_last_page()` is called while `CurrentPageIndex == PageCount - 1`
**Then** `CurrentPageIndex` remains unchanged

### COL-019 — `PagedComposition<TVM>` `PageSize == 0` passes through all items

**Given** a `PagedComposition<TVM>` wrapping a 7-item source with `PageSize == 0`
**When** the composition's paging state and `Items` are queried
**Then** `IsPagingEnabled == false`
**And** `PageCount == 1`
**And** `CurrentPageIndex == 0`
**And** `Items` yields all 7 items

### COL-020 — `PagedComposition<TVM>` empty-source behavior

**Given** a `PagedComposition<TVM>` wrapping an empty source with `PageSize == 5`
**When** the composition's paging state, `Items`, and navigation verbs are exercised

### COL-021 — `PagedComposition<TVM>` composition with `SearchableState<T>`

**Given** a source composition of 10 items
**And** a `SearchableState<ItemVM>` wrapping the source that filters to 4 items

**When** the filter is applied
**Then** `PagedComposition.PageCount == 2` (ceil(4 / 3))
**And** the first page yields the first 3 filtered items
**And** `Items` does NOT include any items filtered out by `SearchableState`

### COL-022 — `ObservableDictionary` hub publication

**Given** an `ObservableDictionary<TKey1, TKey2, TValue>` constructed with an `IMessageHub`
**And** a subscriber recording `CollectionChangedMessage` receipts from the hub
**When** an entry is inserted, then a different entry is removed, then an existing entry is
replaced, then `Clear()` is called
**Then** each mutation publishes exactly one `CollectionChangedMessage` to the hub after
the local `CollectionChanged` event fires
**And** the `Action` field carries the correct value (`Add`, `Remove`, `Replace`,
`Reset`) for each mutation

**Given** an `ObservableDictionary` constructed with no hub (or an explicit null)
**When** the same four mutations are performed
**Then** all mutations complete without raising any exception
**And** no hub message is published

### COL-023 — `ObservableList` batch-end `Count` notification

**Given** an `ObservableList<T>` with at least one item already present
**And** a subscriber recording `Reset` events and `PropertyChanged("Count")` events

**When** a `batch_update`/`withBatch`/`BatchUpdate()` block contains mutations
that change the collection's `Count` (e.g., at least one add or remove)
**Then** the batch-end `Reset` is emitted first
**And** a `PropertyChanged("Count")` notification is emitted immediately after
**And** the `Count` value is already updated when the `PropertyChanged` fires

**When** a `batch_update`/`withBatch`/`BatchUpdate()` block is empty (no mutations)
**Then** no `Reset` is emitted
**And** no `PropertyChanged("Count")` is emitted

**When** a `batch_update`/`withBatch`/`BatchUpdate()` block contains only
count-preserving mutations (e.g., only replace operations)
**Then** a `Reset` is emitted (mutations occurred)
**And** no `PropertyChanged("Count")` is emitted (count unchanged)

### COL-024 — `TokenPagedComposition<TVM,TToken>` initial state

**Given** a token-paged composition with an async `fetch_next` function
**When** the composition is created before any fetch
**Then** `Items` is empty

**And** `LoadMoreCommand.CanExecute` is true

### COL-025 — token load-more appends items and advances token

**Given** a token-paged composition whose first fetch returns items and a next token
**When** `LoadMoreCommand` is executed
**Then** the returned items are appended to `Items`
**And** `CurrentToken` becomes the returned next token
**And** a later load passes that token to `fetch_next`

### COL-026 — terminal token disables load-more

**Given** a token-paged composition whose fetch returns a terminal/null next token
**When** the load completes
**Then** `HasMore` is false
**And** `LoadMoreCommand.CanExecute` is false

### COL-027 — refresh refetches from the initial token

**Given** a token-paged composition with previously loaded items
**When** `RefreshCommand` is executed
**Then** `fetch_next` is called with the initial terminal/null token
**And** the accumulator reflects the refreshed first page
**And** token state reflects the refreshed next token

### COL-028 — refresh dedup suppresses redundant mutation

**Given** a token-paged composition whose refreshed first page matches the current accumulator head
**When** `RefreshCommand` is executed
**Then** the accumulator is not mutated
**And** no `CollectionChanged` event is emitted for the redundant refresh

### COL-029 — token-paged collection changes use reset semantics

**Given** a token-paged composition with a `CollectionChanged` subscriber
**When** a load effectively mutates the accumulator
**Then** exactly one coarse `Reset` collection event is emitted

### COL-030 — token-paged auto-construct-on-add

**Given** a token-paged composition created with auto-construct-on-add enabled
**And** a fetched page contains VMx component VMs
**When** the load completes
**Then** the added component VMs are constructed before subscribers observe the reset event

### COL-031 — `PagedComposition<TVM>` observes composite collection changes

**Given** a finite `PagedComposition<TVM>` wrapping a `CompositeVM<TVM>` source
**And** a property-changed subscriber
**When** the composite source is mutated

**When** `Path` is read on the grandchild
**Then** the returned sequence is `[root, child, grandchild]` (root-first)
**And** a second read of `Path` without any structural change returns an
identical (identity-equal in the same materialization window) sequence
**And** after the grandchild is reparented, the next read of `Path` returns
the updated sequence

### HIER-005 — `IsLeaf` and `IsRoot` derivation

**Given** a root node with two children, where each child has no children
**When** `IsRoot` and `IsLeaf` are read on each node

### HIER-009 — Depth-first construction order (eager mode)

**Given** a two-level eager tree: root with child A; A with child AA
**And** a recorder observing `ConstructionStatus == Constructed` transitions
**When** the root is constructed
**Then** AA transitions to `Constructed` before A
**And** A transitions to `Constructed` before root
**And** root transitions to `Constructed` last

### HIER-010 — `PropertyChangedMessage` on `Parent` change

**Given** a node with a message hub subscriber recording `PropertyChangedMessage`

### HIER-012 — `walk_expanded` honors lazy boundaries via `ExpandableState`

**Given** a three-level tree where the root has `ExpandableState` composed
**And** the root's `IsExpanded` is false
**When** `walk_expanded(root)` is called
**Then** only the root is yielded; its children are NOT traversed
**When** the root is expanded (IsExpanded set to true) and `walk_expanded` is called again
**Then** the root and its direct children are yielded
**And** `HierarchicalVM` does NOT auto-implement `IExpandable` (per ADR-0028 §3.6)

### HIER-013 — Composition with `SearchableState` filters materialized portion

**Given** a tree with several leaf nodes whose models have a `Name` property
**And** a `SearchableState` composed on the tree VM with a name-matching predicate
**When** a search term is set that matches only a subset of leaves
**Then** the filtered view returned by `SearchableState` contains only matching nodes
**And** un-materialized children (lazy nodes not yet accessed) are not included in results

### HIER-014 — Composition with `ModeledCrudCommands` mutates the tree

**Given** a parent node composed with `ModeledCrudCommands` targeting its `Children`
**When** `CreateNewCommand` is executed with a new model
**Then** a new child VM is added to the parent's `Children`
**And** a `TreeStructureChangedMessage` with `Change == Added` is published
**When** `DeleteCurrentCommand` is executed on an existing child
**Then** the child is removed from `Children`
**And** a `TreeStructureChangedMessage` with `Change == Removed` is published

### HIER-015 — `HierarchicalVMBuilder<M, VM>.Build()` validates required fields

**Given** a `HierarchicalVMBuilder<M, VM>` configured with `Model(m)` and
`ChildrenFactory(f)` but no `Services(hub, dispatcher)` call
**When** `.Build()` is called
**Then** a `BuilderValidationError` / `BuilderValidationException` is raised
**And** the exception message identifies `Services` (or the flavor-idiomatic name)

**Given** a builder configured with `ChildrenFactory(f)` + `Services(hub, dispatcher)`
but no `Model`
**When** `.Build()` is called
**Then** the exception message identifies `Model`

**Given** a builder configured with `Model(m)` + `Services(hub, dispatcher)` but no
`ChildrenFactory`

`ChildrenFactory(f)`, `Services(hub, dispatcher)`, `Hint("h")`, `EagerChildren(true)`
**When** `nodeA = b.Build()` and `nodeB = b.Build()` are called
**Then** `nodeA` and `nodeB` are different instances
**And** `nodeA.Model == nodeB.Model == m0`, `nodeA.Hint == nodeB.Hint == "h"`
**And** both nodes' subtrees are materialized at construction time (per `EagerChildren`)

### HIER-017 — `HierarchicalVMBuilder<M, VM>` field defaults applied when not set

**Given** a `HierarchicalVMBuilder<M, VM>` configured with only the required fields
(`Model`, `ChildrenFactory`, `Services`)
**When** `.Build()` is called
**Then** `node.Hint == ""`, `node.Name == typeof(TVM).Name` (or its
flavor-idiomatic equivalent), and `node.Children` is materialized **lazily** on first
access (the default for `EagerChildren = false`)

### HIER-018 — `ReparentChild` rejects self- and ancestor-reparenting — spec v2.5.0

**Given** a hierarchy `root → mid → leaf`
**When** `leaf.ReparentChild(root)` is called (reparenting an ancestor under its own
descendant) or `node.ReparentChild(node)` is called (self-reparenting)
**Then** the flavor's standard invalid-operation error is raised
(`InvalidOperationException` / `ValueError` / `Error`)
**And** the tree structure is unchanged (`Parent`, `Depth`, and `Path` of every node
are as before)
**And** no `TreeStructureChangedMessage` is published

### HIER-019 — `InvalidateChildren` reloads on next access

**Given** a `HierarchicalVM` node whose `Children` have already been materialized
**When** `InvalidateChildren` is called
**And** `Children` is accessed again
**Then** the children factory is invoked again
**And** the new child list replaces the previous cache

### HIER-020 — `InvalidateChildren` on an unmaterialized node is a no-op

**Given** a `HierarchicalVM` node whose `Children` have not been materialized
**When** `InvalidateChildren` is called
**Then** the children factory is not invoked
**And** the next `Children` access still performs the first materialization

### HIER-021 — `InvalidateSubtree` invalidates materialized descendants

**Given** a materialized hierarchy with at least one materialized descendant
**When** `InvalidateSubtree` is called on the root
**Then** the root's cached child list is dropped
**And** every materialized descendant's cached child list is also dropped
**And** subsequent `Children` access re-invokes the relevant factories

### HIER-022 — Child-cache invalidation publishes property changed

**Given** a materialized `HierarchicalVM` node with a hub subscriber
**When** `InvalidateChildren` is called
**Then** a `PropertyChangedMessage` is published for the children property
**And** no `TreeStructureChangedMessage` is required for the cache refresh

## 26. DIA — IDialogService (chapter 19) — spec v2.1

### DIA-001 — `PickFileToOpen` contract

**Given** an `IDialogService` implementation
**And** an optional `FileFilter` with description and extensions, and an optional title
**When** `PickFileToOpen(filter, title)` is called
**Then** it returns an awaitable that resolves to either a non-null path string (user
selected a file) or `null` (user cancelled or no file was chosen)
**And** all parameters are optional (calling with no arguments is valid)

### DIA-002 — `PickFileToSave` contract

**Given** an `IDialogService` implementation
**And** optional `FileFilter`, optional title, and optional `suggestedName`
**When** `PickFileToSave(filter, title, suggestedName)` is called
**Then** it returns an awaitable that resolves to either a non-null path string (user
confirmed a save path) or `null` on cancel
**And** all parameters are optional (calling with no arguments is valid)

### DIA-003 — `Confirm` contract

**Given** an `IDialogService` implementation
**And** a non-null message string and an optional title
**When** `Confirm(message, title)` is called
**Then** it returns an awaitable that resolves to `true` when the user confirms
**And** resolves to `false` when the user cancels or dismisses the prompt
**And** the title parameter is optional (calling with only message is valid)

### DIA-004 — `Notify` contract

**Given** an `IDialogService` implementation
**And** a non-null message string, an optional title, and an optional severity
**When** `Notify(message, title, severity)` is called with severity in
`{Info, Warning, Error}`
**Then** it returns an awaitable that completes without error
**And** severity defaults to `Info` when not supplied
**And** all optional parameters may be omitted

### DIA-005 — `NullDialogService` null-object behavior

**Given** a `NullDialogService` instance (per ADR-0017)
**When** `PickFileToOpen()` is awaited
**Then** the result is `null`
**When** `PickFileToSave()` is awaited
**Then** the result is `null`
**When** `Confirm("any message")` is awaited
**Then** the result is `false`
**When** `Notify("any message")` is awaited
**Then** the awaitable completes without error and without side-effects

### DIA-006 — Reentrancy is implementation-defined

**Given** a queueing `IDialogService` implementation that serialises concurrent calls
**When** two `Confirm` calls are made concurrently
**Then** both awaitables eventually resolve with valid values (`true` or `false`)
**And** neither call raises an exception due to reentrancy

**Given** an immediate-rejecting `IDialogService` implementation
**When** a second `Confirm` call is made while the first is still pending
**Then** the second call resolves immediately with `false` (safe default)
**And** no exception is raised
**And** the first call continues to completion unaffected

### DIA-007 — Cancellation completes with safe default, does not throw

The `IDialogService` contract does not include a cancellation parameter; this
scenario applies to implementations that opt into a cancellation channel
(e.g., a custom subtype that adds a `CancellationToken` / `AbortSignal`
overload, or a host that disposes the awaiting context).

**Given** an opt-in cancellable dialog implementation
**And** a cancellation signal that fires before or during the dialog
**When** the file-pick await is cancelled
**Then** the awaitable completes with `null` (no file chosen)
**And** no cancellation exception is raised by the awaitable itself
**When** the confirm await is cancelled
**Then** the awaitable completes with `false`
**And** no cancellation exception is raised

### DIA-008 — `ConfirmationDecoratorCommand` integration

**Given** an `ICommand` inner command
**And** an `IDialogService` instance
**When** `innerCommand.Confirm(() => dialogService.Confirm("Proceed?"))` is called
(or the fluent `innerCommand.Confirm(dialogService, "Proceed?")` overload)
**Then** the result is a valid `ICommand` whose `CanExecute` delegates to the inner
command and whose `Execute` first awaits the dialog's `Confirm` result
**And** the inner command is only executed when `Confirm` returns `true`
**And** the inner command is NOT executed when `Confirm` returns `false`

### DIA-009 — VM-backed modal presentation returns the modal result

**Given** a modal VM with a cancellation result
**And** a modal-capable dialog service whose host chooses result `r`
**When** `Present(modal)` is awaited
**Then** the awaitable resolves to `r`
**And** the modal's `Result` is `r`

### DIA-010 — Null modal presentation resolves with cancellation result

**Given** a `NullDialogService`
**And** a modal VM with cancellation result `c`
**When** `Present(modal)` is awaited
**Then** the awaitable resolves to `c`
**And** the modal is dismissed with result `c`

### DIA-011 — Modal disposal completes with cancellation result

**Given** a modal VM with cancellation result `c`
**When** the modal is disposed before a host result is chosen
**Then** the modal's completion awaitable resolves to `c`
**And** the modal is dismissed

### DIA-012 — Modal dismissal is idempotent

**Given** a modal VM
**When** `Dismiss(first)` is called
**And** `Dismiss(second)` is called later
**Then** the modal completion resolves to `first`
**And** the stored result remains `first`

### DIA-013 — Existing dialog methods remain source-compatible

**Given** a `NullDialogService` consumed through the existing dialog-service surface
**When** `PickFileToOpen`, `PickFileToSave`, `Confirm`, and `Notify` are called
**Then** they retain their existing names, parameters, and null-object return values

## 27. FORM — FormVM (chapter 20) — spec v2.1

### FORM-001 — Snapshot captured at construct

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` constructed with an initial model `m0` and a no-op persister
**When** `Snapshot` and `Model` are read immediately after construction
**Then** `Snapshot == m0` (structurally equal to the initial value)
**And** `Model == m0`
**And** `IsDirty == false`

### FORM-002 — Model mutation reflected in `IsDirty`

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` with initial model `m0`
**When** `Model` is updated to a structurally different value `m1`
**Then** `IsDirty == true`
**And** `Model` equals `m1`
**And** `Snapshot` still equals `m0` (unchanged)

### FORM-003 — `IsDirty` derivation via structural inequality

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` with initial model `m0`
**When** `Model` is updated to a value `m1` that is structurally equal to `m0`
(same fields/values, different object reference if applicable)
**Then** `IsDirty == false` (equal values are not dirty)
**When** `Model` is updated to a value `m2` that differs from `m0` in at least one field
**Then** `IsDirty == true`

**Note** (v3, ADR-0048; supersedes the ADR-0037 caveat): structural equality is
evaluated by each flavor's chapter 20 §4 mechanism — `object.Equals` (C#),
`__eq__` (Python), and an injectable structural deep-equal (TypeScript, default).
The pre-v3 TypeScript `JSON.stringify` comparison was key-order sensitive and
crashed on `BigInt`/circular models; the v3 default deep-equal is order-insensitive
and handles `Date`/`Map`/`Set`/`BigInt`/circular references, so the equal-values
guarantee now holds unconditionally in all three flavors. Consumers needing
field-subset or reference semantics inject a custom `equals` (TypeScript) or define
their model's own equality (C#/Python).

### FORM-004 — `DenyCommand` reverts `Model` to `Snapshot`

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` with initial model `m0`
**And** `Model` has been updated to a different value `m1` (so `IsDirty == true`)
**When** `DenyCommand.Execute()` is called
**Then** `Model` is restored to a value structurally equal to `Snapshot`
**And** `IsDirty == false`
**And** the persister is NOT invoked

### FORM-005 — `ApproveCommand` invokes persister; snapshot advances on success

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` with initial model `m0` and a persister that records its argument
**And** `Model` has been updated to `m1`
**When** `ApproveAsync()` is awaited and the persister succeeds
**Then** the persister was called with `m1`
**And** `Snapshot` is updated to a value structurally equal to `m1`
**And** `IsDirty == false` after the approve completes

### FORM-006 — `OnApproved` fires only after successful persist

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` with a subscriber to `OnApproved`
**And** `Model` has been updated to `m1`
**When** `ApproveAsync()` is awaited and the persister succeeds
**Then** `OnApproved` fires exactly once with the persisted value — the model
captured before the persister await (`m1`), uniform across flavors (chapter 20 §7;
a `SetModel` racing the in-flight persist does not change the emitted value —
ADR-0048)

**Given** a persister that throws an exception
**When** `ApproveAsync()` is awaited
**Then** `OnApproved` does NOT fire

### FORM-007 — Persist failure leaves state unchanged

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` with a persister that throws `InvalidOperationException`
**And** `Model` has been updated to `m1` (so `IsDirty == true`)
**And** `Snapshot` equals `m0`
**When** `ApproveAsync()` is awaited and the persister throws
**Then** `Snapshot` is still `m0` (unchanged)
**And** `Model` is still `m1` (unchanged)
**And** `IsDirty` is still `true`
**And** the awaitable surfaces the exception to the caller (the exception
is observable via the awaitable entry-point only; `ApproveCommand.Execute()`
dispatches the persist call fire-and-forget per chapter 20 §2)

### FORM-008 — Hub messages on revert

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` connected to a message hub
**And** `Model` has been updated to `m1`
**And** subscribers are recording `FormRevertedMessage` and `PropertyChangedMessage`
**When** `DenyCommand.Execute()` is called
**Then** exactly one `FormRevertedMessage` is published with `Sender == formVm`
**And** exactly one `PropertyChangedMessage` with `PropertyName == "Model"` is
published after the revert

### FORM-009 — Strict mode: `ApproveCommand.CanExecute` gates on `IsDirty`

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` constructed with `strict = true`
**When** `IsDirty == false` (no mutations since last snapshot)
**Then** `ApproveCommand.CanExecute()` returns `false`
**When** `Model` is updated to a structurally different value (so `IsDirty == true`)
**Then** `ApproveCommand.CanExecute()` returns `true`

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` constructed with `strict = false` (default)
**When** `IsDirty == false`
**Then** `ApproveCommand.CanExecute()` returns `true` (consumer-controlled)

### FORM-010 — Integration with `IDialogService.Confirm`

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` with `Model` updated to `m1` (dirty)
**And** a `NullDialogService` (whose `Confirm` always returns `false`)
**And** a confirmation-decorated deny command:
`confirmedDeny = denyCommand.Confirm(() => dialogService.Confirm("Discard changes?"))`
**When** `confirmedDeny.Execute()` is called
**Then** `Confirm` on the dialog service is called
**And** because it returns `false`, `DenyCommand.Execute()` is NOT invoked
**And** `Model` is still `m1` (not reverted)
**And** `IsDirty` is still `true`

### FORM-011 — `FormVMBuilder<TM>.Build()` validates required `Initial` + `Persister`

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>.Builder()` with only `Initial(m)` set (no `Persister`)
**When** `.Build()` is called
**Then** a `BuilderValidationError` / `BuilderValidationException` is raised
**And** the exception message identifies `Persister` (or the flavor-idiomatic name)

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>.Builder()` with only `Persister(p)` set (no `Initial`)
**When** `.Build()` is called
**Then** a `BuilderValidationError` / `BuilderValidationException` is raised
**And** the exception message identifies `Initial`

### FORM-012 — `FormVMBuilder<TM>` repeated identical Build calls

**Given** a `FormVMBuilder<TM>` `b` fully configured with `Initial(m0)`, `Persister(p)`,
optional `Strict(true)`, `Hub(hub)`, `Snapshotter(s)`
**When** `formA = b.Build()` and `formB = b.Build()` are called
**Then** `formA` and `formB` are different instances
**And** `formA.Model == formB.Model == m0`, `formA.Snapshot == formB.Snapshot == s(m0)`
**And** `formA.IsDirty == formB.IsDirty == false`

### FORM-013 — `FormVMBuilder<TM>` field defaults applied when not set

**Given** a `FormVMBuilder<TM>` configured with only `Initial(m0)` + `Persister(p)`
**When** `.Build()` is called
**Then** `form.Hub == NullMessageHub` (singleton equivalent for the flavor)
**And** `form.Snapshot == m0` (the default snapshotter deep-copies — chapter 20 §3)
**And** `form.ApproveCommand.CanExecute() == true` regardless of `IsDirty`
(strict defaults to `false`)

### FORM-014 — Disposed form is inert

**Given** a `FormVM` whose persister records its invocations, with
`Model != Snapshot` (dirty)
**When** `Dispose()` is called and then `ApproveCommand` (or the awaitable
approve entry point) and `DenyCommand` are executed
**Then** the persister is never invoked
**And** `Model` retains its pre-dispose value (no revert)
**And** no exception is raised

*(Added in v2.5.0 via ADR-0038 — the guards shipped as v2.5.0 maintenance;
this ID pins them normatively.)*

### FORM-015 — `ApproveCommand` surfaces persister failure on `ApproveErrors`

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` whose persister rejects/throws an error `e`
**And** a subscriber to `ApproveErrors`
**And** `Model` has been updated to `m1` (so `IsDirty == true`)
**When** `ApproveCommand.Execute()` is invoked (the fire-and-forget command path)
**Then** the error `e` is emitted on `ApproveErrors` (it is not swallowed with the
discarded faulted task)
**And** no state is mutated: `Snapshot` is unchanged and `IsDirty` is still `true`
**And** `OnApproved` does not fire

*(Added in v3 via ADR-0048. The awaitable `ApproveAsync()` path keeps its
throw-to-the-awaiter behavior — FORM-007 — and emits nothing on `ApproveErrors`;
this ID pins the command-path error channel, chapter 20 §2/§8.)*

### FORM-016 — Field validator populates field error

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` constructed with a field validator for field `f`
**When** the current model fails that validator
**Then** `FieldError(f)` returns the validator's string error
**And** `Errors[f]` contains the same error

### FORM-017 — Model validator populates errors

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` constructed with a model validator
**When** the validator returns a field-name keyed error map
**Then** `Errors` contains those field errors

### FORM-018 — `IsValid` reflects errors

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` whose validators produce one or more errors
**Then** `IsValid == false`
**And** when the effective `Errors` map is empty, `IsValid == true`

### FORM-019 — Invalid form blocks approval

**Given** an invalid `FormVM<TM>` whose persister records invocations
**When** `ApproveCommand.CanExecute` is queried
**Then** it returns `false`
**When** the awaitable approve entry point is called
**Then** the persister is not invoked

### FORM-020 — Validation reruns after model mutation

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` whose current model has validation errors
**When** `SetModel` replaces it with a valid model
**Then** `Errors` becomes empty
**And** `IsValid == true`

### FORM-021 — `ErrorsChanged` fires only on effective changes

**Given** a `FormVM<TM>` with a subscriber to `ErrorsChanged`
**When** `SetModel` changes the model but produces the same effective errors
**Then** no error-change event is emitted
**When** `SetModel` changes the effective error map
**Then** exactly one fresh error map is emitted for that change

### FORM-022 — `FormVMBuilder<TM>` registers validators immutably

**Given** a configured `FormVM<TM>.Builder()`
**When** `Validator(field, fn)` is called
**Then** a new builder instance is returned
**And** the original builder is unchanged
**And** the new builder constructs a form that applies the validator

### FORM-023 — Clearing errors enables approval when other gates pass

**Given** a strict `FormVM<TM>` with validation errors
**When** `SetModel` changes the model so validation passes and the form is dirty
**Then** `ApproveCommand.CanExecute == true`

## 28. DISC — DiscriminatorVM (chapter 22) — spec v3.1

### DISC-001 — Initial active key and `IsActive`

**Given** a `DiscriminatorVM<TKey>` constructed with initial key `k0`
**Then** `ActiveKey == k0`
**And** `IsActive(k0) == true`
**And** `IsActive(other) == false`

### DISC-002 — Changing active key emits once

**Given** a `DiscriminatorVM<TKey>` with a subscriber to `ActiveChanged`
**When** `SetActiveKey(k1)` is called with `k1 != ActiveKey`
**Then** `ActiveKey == k1`
**And** the subscriber observes exactly one emission carrying `k1`

### DISC-003 — Setting the same key is a no-op

**Given** a `DiscriminatorVM<TKey>` with active key `k0`
**And** a subscriber to `ActiveChanged`
**When** `SetActiveKey(k0)` is called
**Then** no change is emitted

### DISC-004 — Modal open activates modal key

**Given** a `DiscriminatorVM<TKey>` with active key `k0`
**When** `ModalOpen(modalKey)` is called
**Then** `ActiveKey == modalKey`
**And** `IsActive(modalKey) == true`

### DISC-005 — Modal close restores prior key

**Given** a `DiscriminatorVM<TKey>` with active key `k0`
**And** `SetActiveKey(k1)` has been called
**When** `ModalOpen(modalKey)` is called
**And** `ModalClose()` is called
**Then** `ActiveKey == k1`

### DISC-006 — Nested modal precedence restores in LIFO order

**Given** a `DiscriminatorVM<TKey>` with active key `k0`
**When** `ModalOpen(a)` then `ModalOpen(b)` are called
**And** `ModalClose()` is called once
**Then** `ActiveKey == a`
**When** `ModalClose()` is called again
**Then** `ActiveKey == k0`

## 29. THEME — Theme as a VM concern (spec v2.4 scenario contract)

The `THEME-NNN` family covers the **scenario contract** at
`spec/proposals/2026-06-02-theme-vm-scenario.md` (ADR-0036 §2.C). This contract
specifies a normative *shape* for example-app theming — a `ThemeModel` +
`ThemeVM : ComponentVM<ThemeModel>` + per-framework `ThemeAdapter` — built
from existing core primitives (`ComponentVM<M>`, `DerivedProperty<T>`,
`RelayCommand`, `MessageHub`). No new core types are introduced.

Scenarios are normative for any flavor or example app that implements the
contract; flavors that do not host an example-app theming surface are NOT
required to provide coverage. Verbatim from the proposal §6.

### THEME-001 — `setThemeCommand.execute("dark")` publishes `ThemeChangedMessage` exactly once; `currentTheme.value.name == "dark"`; `currentTheme.value.accentColor` equals the "dark" preset's accent

**Given** a `ThemeVM` constructed with the three named presets
(`"dark"`, `"light"`, `"high-contrast"`) and a hub subscriber filtered on
`ThemeChangedMessage`
**When** `setThemeCommand.execute("dark")` is called
**Then** the subscriber observes exactly one `ThemeChangedMessage` with
`curr.name == "dark"` and `curr.accentColor` equal to the configured "dark"
preset's `accentColor`
**And** `currentTheme.value.name == "dark"`

### THEME-002 — `setThemeCommand.execute("unknown-preset")` raises `BuilderValidationError` (or flavor-idiomatic exception) without publishing a message

**Given** a `ThemeVM` configured with only the three named presets and a hub
subscriber filtered on `ThemeChangedMessage`
**When** `setThemeCommand.execute("unknown-preset")` is called
**Then** a `BuilderValidationError` / `BuilderValidationException` /
`ValueError` (flavor-idiomatic) is raised
**And** the subscriber observes zero `ThemeChangedMessage` emissions
**And** `currentTheme.value` is unchanged from its pre-call value

### THEME-003 — `toggleHighContrast` toggles `currentTheme.value.highContrast` without changing accent or scale

**Given** a `ThemeVM` whose `currentTheme.value` has
`highContrast == false`, `accentColor == "#1F6FEB"`, `fontScaleFactor == 1.0`
**When** `toggleHighContrast.execute()` is called
**Then** `currentTheme.value.highContrast == true`
**And** `currentTheme.value.accentColor == "#1F6FEB"` (unchanged)
**And** `currentTheme.value.fontScaleFactor == 1.0` (unchanged)
**When** `toggleHighContrast.execute()` is called a second time
**Then** `currentTheme.value.highContrast == false` (flipped back)

### THEME-004 — `setFontScale(value)` clamps to `[0.75..1.75]` and publishes a single `ThemeChangedMessage`; values outside the range result in clamped emission, not rejection

**Given** a `ThemeVM` with `currentTheme.value.fontScaleFactor == 1.0` and a
hub subscriber filtered on `ThemeChangedMessage`
**When** `setFontScale.execute(0.5)` is called
**Then** the subscriber observes exactly one `ThemeChangedMessage`
**And** `currentTheme.value.fontScaleFactor == 0.75` (clamped to lower bound)
**When** `setFontScale.execute(3.0)` is called
**Then** the subscriber observes a second `ThemeChangedMessage`
**And** `currentTheme.value.fontScaleFactor == 1.75` (clamped to upper bound)
**When** `setFontScale.execute(1.25)` is called
**Then** `currentTheme.value.fontScaleFactor == 1.25` (in-range, unclamped)

### THEME-005 — `followSystemCommand.execute()` sets `followSystem=true` and re-reads the host's current theme; calling `setThemeCommand.execute("dark")` afterward sets `followSystem=false` automatically

**Given** a `ThemeVM` whose `currentTheme.value.followSystem == false`
**When** `followSystemCommand.execute()` is called
**Then** `currentTheme.value.followSystem == true`
**And** `currentTheme.value.name` equals the host-derived system theme name
(e.g., `"dark"` when the host reports a dark color scheme)
**When** `setThemeCommand.execute("dark")` is called afterward
**Then** `currentTheme.value.followSystem == false`
**And** `currentTheme.value.name == "dark"`
