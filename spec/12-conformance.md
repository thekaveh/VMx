# 12 — Conformance test catalog

This document enumerates every stable conformance test identifier in the form
`XXX-NNN`. Every language flavor MUST implement a passing test for each ID in its
`langs/<lang>/tests/conformance/` directory before it can be marked stable. CI
verifies this via `tools/check-conformance-coverage.py`.

## Identifier prefixes
